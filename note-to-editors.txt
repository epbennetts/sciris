Sciris is a collection of classes and functions that simplify multiple aspects of scientific computing workflows -- such as parallelization, plotting, saving and loading files, etc. No part of the paper has been previously published, although Fig. 1 of this paper was adapted from Fig. 5 of a SciPy conference paper (https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2022/pdfs/cliff_kerr.pdf). We declare no conflicts of interests. We acknowledge that this submission is somewhat longer than typical JOSS submissions; we believe its length is justified since Sciris covers a wide range of topic areas, but we are also willing to shorten it if required.
