.. currentmodule:: sciris

There's a lot here! Use the links on the left for navigation.

Note: functions in Sciris are of course organized into submodules. However, standard
usage is to call the functions directly, e.g. :func:`sc.parallelize() <sc_parallel.parallelize>` instead
of ``sc.sc_parallel.parallelize()``.
