These tutorials illustrate the main features of Sciris. They roughly make the most sense in the order listed, but can be done in any order. Each one should take a few minutes to skim through, or 15-30 minutes to go through in detail. Each tutorial contains a link to an interactive version running on `Binder <http://mybinder.org>`_.

    .. grid-item-card:: 8 Dates and times
        :link: tut_dates
        :link-type: doc
        
        Compared to nice, simple numbers, dates are a pain to work with. This tutorial goes through some ways to work with them more easily.
